==================================================
 Pyposo: create reStructuredText  programatically
==================================================

This is one of my first big programming projects and it's heavily
influenced by `Panflute <http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/>`_.

I created it for another project in which I hope to use this one since I
didn't find any good python library for this job. If there is one,
please let me know!
